# Cart Application
A simple cart application that allows users to browse through lists of products as well add these products to the cart. Users are also able to view the products they have added through the cart side bar in addition to being able to add and reduce quantities for a specific product in the cart. 

This project is built using TypeScript, ReactJS, and Fake Store API (which is used to obtain the products data).

### Other Notes
This is a refactored version of my older Cart Application that uses JavaScript. My motivation for recreating the application is for me to practice using useContext hooks to make the whole codebase more readable as well to get a hands on feel towards using TypeScript as this was the project where I have made use of TypeScript for the first time. The repo link for the old Cart Application can be found [here](https://github.com/AngeloAXNGR/react-shopping-cart).
